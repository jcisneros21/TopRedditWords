Im pretty sure that Trump did collude with the russians,Russia is known to fund and establish close links to the same kind of far right populism in Europe as well.  Even if he did not the russians heavily favoured him as they saw him as the weaker candidate that would further strain the US relations with its allies and put an element of chaos into the western alliance.

When you start getting into our slide into authoritarianism it doesn't matter if you agree with the policies or not, or if you like the president or not. There were plenty of tea party republicans warning democrats that they are not going to like the result of Obama's expansion of executive power when the tables are turned.
